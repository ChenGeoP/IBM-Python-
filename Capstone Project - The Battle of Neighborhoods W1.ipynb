    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "As the most famous city in the world, New York City is seen as a business hub with a variety of people. Whilst being a business district and hub, New York is in a major hunt to ensure people have the opportunity to enjoy the worldwilde food. In the meantime, chinese food has been very popolar over the western world. A traitional chiense hot pot group is looking to open a flagship resturant in one of New Yorkâ€™s neighbourhoods. This will be the first resutrant of that hot pot brand in the US. It does not understand the area and the availability of chinese resturant in each neighbourhood and requires an investigation to take place in order to determine the best place for the franchise to open a new gym."
